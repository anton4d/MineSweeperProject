# Journey

Every day shall be documented for a journey of what
 I have learned and what the problems are for the next day.

There is currently no format but, I might create one in the future.
The only formatting rules are the name of the file need to be the date (dd_mm_yyyy) and required headings are:
- Work Done Today
- Problems
    - Stuff Learned From Problems
- Next Workday To-Do
