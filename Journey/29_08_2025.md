# Work Done Today

Start up and set up the markdowns, have decided that the first version should be a simple CLI version made in python.
To start a project, A list of functional requirements and non-functional.
The list of requirements is just a start it will evolve as I work with the project.

The first main problem is random numbers i could just use pythons random module. 
But I wanted to understand it before just using is. 

After using it I want to create my own random generator also using the Mersenne Twister since that is the generator pythons random module uses. 

But the most import part of starting a project is finishing it. I will go with the random module until the game works and trust it works. 

# Problems

- Random numbers

## Stuff Learned From Problems

The main thing I learned is Random numbers are a lot more complicated than I thought, but that is very interesting.  
[Random number Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators)  

Creating my own is probably going to be its own project at some point.
